# Pet Match 
Pet Match is an android application that connects pet owners with potential adopters. Users can post pets for adoption, and interested adopters can apply directly through the app.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating Pet Match was to simplify the pet adoption process by providing a platform where pet owners and potential adopters can connect easily. Recognizing the challenges both parties face in finding the right match, this app aims to streamline the adoption process, making it easier for pets to find loving homes and for adopters to find the perfect companion.

## Build Status
The main functionalities of **Pet Match** are complete and operational, including:
